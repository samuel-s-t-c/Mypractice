        --color auto|always|never
                        Configure coloring of output:
                        auto = colorize if stdout is a tty and tests are run
                        on serially (default);

                        Configure formatting of output:

                        terse = Display one character per test;
                        json = Output a json document
        --show-output   Show captured stdout of successful tests
    -Z unstable-options Enable nightly-only flags:
                        unstable-options = Allow use of experimental features
        --report-time [plain|colored]
                        Show execution time of each test. Awailable values:
                        plain = do not colorize the execution time (default);
                        colored = colorize output according to the `color`
                        parameter value;
                        Threshold values for colorized output can be
                        configured via
                        `RUST_TEST_TIME_UNIT`, `RUST_TEST_TIME_INTEGRATION`
                        and
                        `RUST_TEST_TIME_DOCTEST` environment variables.
                        Expected format of environment variable is
                        `VARIABLE=WARN_TIME,CRITICAL_TIME`.
                        Durations must be specified in milliseconds, e.g.
                        `500,2000` means that the warn time
                        is 0.5 seconds, and the critical time is 2 seconds.
                        Not available for --format=terse
        --ensure-time   Treat excess of the test execution time limit as
                        error.
                        Threshold values for this option can be configured via
                        `RUST_TEST_TIME_UNIT`, `RUST_TEST_TIME_INTEGRATION`
                        and
                        `RUST_TEST_TIME_DOCTEST` environment variables.
                        Expected format of environment variable is
                        `VARIABLE=WARN_TIME,CRITICAL_TIME`.
                        `CRITICAL_TIME` here means the limit that should not
                        be exceeded by test.


The FILTER string is tested against the name of all tests, and only those
tests whose names contain the filter are run.

By default, all tests are run in parallel. This can be altered with the
--test-threads flag or the RUST_TEST_THREADS environment variable when running
tests (set it to 1).

All tests have their standard output and standard error captured by default.
This can be overridden with the --nocapture flag or setting RUST_TEST_NOCAPTURE
environment variable to a value other than "0". Logging is not captured by default.

Test Attributes:

    `#[test]`        - Indicates a function is a test to be run. This function
                       takes no arguments.
    `#[bench]`       - Indicates a function is a benchmark to be run. This
                       function takes one argument (test::Bencher).
    `#[should_panic]` - This function (also labeled with `#[test]`) will only pass if
                        the code causes a panic (an assertion failure or panic!)
                        A message may be provided, which the failure string must
                        contain: #[should_panic(expected = "foo")].
    `#[ignore]`       - When applied to a function which is already attributed as a
                        test, then the test runner will ignore these tests during
                        normal test runs. Running with --ignored or --include-ignored will run
                        these tests.
